This project estimates the rotational velocity of a DC motor using an encoder with a resolution of 360 pulses per revolution (PPR). The code calculates velocity by measuring the change in angle over time, handling input from external interrupts, and displaying results on an LCD. Two methods (code-1 and code-2) are implemented, each with specific constraints regarding maximum speed and PPR. These methods highlight considerations for accuracy and performance, particularly when operating beyond 2400 PPR or 333 RPM. The project serves as an exploration of velocity estimation in embedded systems with encoders.
